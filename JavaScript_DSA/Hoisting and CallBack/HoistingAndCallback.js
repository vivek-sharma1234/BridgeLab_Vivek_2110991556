//Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase. This means you can use variables and functions in your code before they are declared. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

//A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation or event is completed.

//In a synchronous callback, the execution of the callback function happens immediately.
//In an asynchronous callback, the callback function is executed after a certain operation completes, usually after a delay or when a resource becomes available

// Advantages of Callbacks
// Allows for asynchronous programming, improving application performance.
// Promotes code reuse by separating logic into modular, reusable functions.
